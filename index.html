          <h1>ALI IBN ABI TALIB</h1>
         
          <p class="about">
            <span>
            Ali ibn Abi Talib (علي بن أبي طالب) was the cousin and son-in-law of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, born inside the Kaaba on the 13th of Rajab. Raised in the Prophet’s household, he was the first male to embrace Islam and remained a devoted supporter throughout his life. He married Fatimah al-Zahra (AS) and was the father of Hasan (AS) and Husayn (AS).  
            <br>
          </span>

          <span>
            Ali (AS) was renowned for his wisdom, bravery, and deep knowledge. He played a key role in major battles like Badr, Uhud, Khandaq, and Khaybar, where he famously lifted the fortress gate. His sermons and sayings are preserved in Nahjul Balagha, showcasing his intellect and philosophy.  
            <br>
          </span>

          <span>
            As a ruler, he upheld justice, humility, and righteousness. He was martyred in Masjid Kufa while in prayer, his last words being, "I have succeeded, by the Lord of the Kaaba!" His legacy of faith, sacrifice, and wisdom continues to inspire generations.</span>

                    <h2>Arrival at Ghadeer Khumm</h2>
                    <p>
                        After completing the farewell Hajj in 632 CE, Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and thousands of companions stopped at Ghadeer Khumm, an important crossroad near Juhfa. It was a scorching hot day, yet the Prophet ordered the entire caravan to halt.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The reason? A divine command had just been revealed:  
                        <b>“O Messenger, proclaim what has been sent down to you from your Lord…” (Quran 5:67)</b>  
                        This moment would define the future leadership of the Muslim Ummah.

                    <h2>The Historic Declaration</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Prophet ﷺ stood on a makeshift pulpit of camel saddles and delivered a long sermon.  
                        He reminded the people: "Do I not have more authority over you than your own selves?"  
                        The crowd replied: "Yes, O Messenger of Allah!"
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then came the pivotal moment:  
                        <b>“Whomever I am his Mawla (guardian, leader), then Ali is his Mawla.”</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This was a public declaration of Imam Ali (AS) as his successor.

                    <h2>Divine Confirmation</h2>
                    <p>
                        As soon as the Prophet ﷺ made the announcement, a verse of the Quran was revealed:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <b>“This day, I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you, and have approved for you Islam as your religion.” (Quran 5:3)</b>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        This verse confirmed that the religion of Islam had been completed with Imam Ali’s (AS) appointment.

                    <p>
                        The Prophet ﷺ then asked everyone to come forward and pledge allegiance to Imam Ali (AS).  
                        The first to do so was Umar ibn Khattab, who congratulated Ali, saying:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        “Congratulations, O Ali! You have now become the Mawla of every believing man and woman.”
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Thousands followed, one by one, acknowledging Imam Ali’s (AS) role as their leader and guide.

            <h2>Battle of Badr</h2>
            <p>The Battle of Badr (624 CE / 2 AH) was the first major battle in Islam, fought between the Muslims of Madinah and the Quraysh of Makkah. The Quraysh, numbering around 1,000 soldiers, had superior arms and cavalry, while the Muslims, led by Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ), had only 313 warriors with limited resources. Imam Ali (عليه السلام) played a pivotal role in securing victory for the Muslims. Out of the 70 Quraysh warriors killed, he personally slayed 22 of them. One of the most significant moments was the pre-battle duel, where three Quraysh champions, Utbah ibn Rabi'ah, Shaybah ibn Rabi'ah, and Waleed ibn Utbah, challenged the Muslims. Imam Ali (عليه السلام), along with Hamza ibn Abdul Muttalib and Ubaydah ibn Harith, stepped forward. Imam Ali swiftly defeated Waleed ibn Utbah, displaying his unmatched combat skills. Throughout the battle, he fought valiantly, cutting through enemy ranks and instilling fear in the hearts of the Quraysh. His bravery, alongside divine support, led to a resounding Muslim victory.</p>
            <blockquote>"And indeed, Allah made you victorious at Badr when you were few in number..." (Quran 3:123)</blockquote>

            <h2>Battle of Uhud</h2>
            <p>The Battle of Uhud (625 CE / 3 AH) was fought as a retaliation by the Quraysh after their defeat at Badr. This time, the Quraysh amassed an army of 3,000 soldiers, while the Muslims had 700 fighters. Initially, the Muslims gained the upper hand, with Imam Ali (عليه السلام) fighting on the front lines. He single-handedly eliminated several key Quraysh warriors and stood as an impenetrable shield for the Prophet (ﷺ). However, due to a tactical mistake by the Muslim archers, the Quraysh launched a counterattack led by Khalid ibn al-Walid. The Prophet (ﷺ) was injured, and many fled the battlefield, but Imam Ali (عليه السلام) remained steadfast, defending the Prophet with unmatched courage. When the enemy sought to assassinate the Prophet, Imam Ali (عليه السلام) repelled them, ensuring his safety. His unwavering loyalty in the face of danger was a testament to his faith and valor.</p>
            <blockquote>"There is no sword but Zulfiqar, and there is no hero but Ali." (Hadith)</blockquote>

            <h2>Battle of Khandaq</h2>
            <p>The Battle of Khandaq (627 CE / 5 AH), also known as the Battle of the Trench, was a defensive battle where the Muslims, under the strategic advice of Salman al-Farsi, dug a trench around Madinah to prevent the 10,000-strong Quraysh army from invading. The battle reached its climax when the Quraysh’s greatest warrior, Amr ibn Abd al-Wud, crossed the trench and challenged the Muslims. No one dared to face him, but Imam Ali (عليه السلام) stepped forward. The Prophet (ﷺ) famously declared, “The entire faith has gone against the entire disbelief.” In a legendary duel, Imam Ali (عليه السلام) swiftly overpowered Amr and beheaded him, breaking the morale of the Quraysh. His victory in this duel marked the turning point of the battle, ensuring the safety of Madinah.</p>
            <blockquote>"Ali’s strike on the day of Khandaq is superior to the worship of all men and jinn." (Hadith)</blockquote>

            <h2>Battle of Khaibar</h2>
            <p>The Battle of Khaybar (628 CE / 7 AH) was a decisive confrontation against the Jewish tribes of Khaybar, who conspired against the Muslims. The fortresses of Khaybar were heavily fortified, and the Muslims initially struggled to breach them. After failed attempts by other commanders, the Prophet (ﷺ) famously stated, “Tomorrow, I will give the banner to a man who loves Allah and His Messenger, and Allah and His Messenger love him.” The next day, he handed the banner to Imam Ali (عليه السلام), who, despite suffering from an eye infection, stormed the fortress. He miraculously lifted the massive gate of Khaybar, using it as a shield and bridge for the Muslim army. His extraordinary strength and valor led to a swift Muslim victory.</p>

            <h2>Battle of Siffin</h2>
            <p>The Battle of Siffin (657 AD) was a major conflict between Imam Ali (AS) and Mu'awiya ibn Abi Sufyan. It arose due to Mu'awiya’s refusal to accept Imam Ali’s rightful caliphate. The battle lasted for over three months, featuring intense combat.</p>
            <p>When Imam Ali’s forces were nearing victory, Mu'awiya resorted to deception, instructing his soldiers to raise copies of the Quran on their spears, tricking some of Imam Ali’s followers into ceasing the fight. This led to arbitration, weakening Imam Ali’s position and causing deep divisions in the Muslim Ummah.</p>
